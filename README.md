# Mokona2D

Utilized Java's Graphics2D class to draw the anime character, Mokona. 

Mokona is the name given to the two rabbit-like creatures from Clamp's sister series, xxxHolic and Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicles.
(Mokona also appeared in one of Clamp's earlier works, Magic Knight Rayearth. It was actually on this anime that I first met Mokona.
The White Mokona to be exact. I just met the Black Mokona later on xxxHolic. They both have real names.
The Black Mokona is called Larg, while the White Mokona is called Soel.)

Unfortunately, I only drew White Mokona. After all, all I need to do is to change White Mokona's red gem to blue and the remaining 
white colors to black and I will have Black Mokona.

My drawing contains two versions: (1) Mokona2D Version 1 makes use of Shapes like QuadCurves and CubicCurves, while 
(2) Mokona2D Version 2 makes use of the GeneralPath (besides the usual Shapes) and is colored unlike version 1.
